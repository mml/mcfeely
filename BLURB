mcfeely is a set of programs that automate the asynchronous execution
of programs on remote (or local) hosts.  It supports a retry mechanism
analogous to what mail daemons do.  It supports batching up a bunch of
tasks together as a job.  The job can have complex dependencies (e.g.
task A depends upon task B which depends on both tasks C and D and
task C depends upon task D).  Reports of failure and (optionally)
success are emailed for each job.

Using some simple port redirection and ssh tunnels, you can encrypt
all mcfeely inter-host transmissions.
