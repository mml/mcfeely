mcfeely-start - start system for a McFeely server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<mcfeely-start>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<mcfeely-start> program is used to start a mcfeely server.
B<mcfeely-start> is responsible for changing directory to the base
mcfeely directory, establishing two pipes, and exec'ing the
B<mcfeely-manage> and B<mcfeely-spawn> programs, passing as arguments
the file descriptors of the pipes that connect them. B<mcfeely-manage>
also receives the pid of mcfeely-spawn (the child of mcfeely-manage).
