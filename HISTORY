A Brief History of McFeely and how it got its name
By Adrian J.C. Liggett-McFeely

This software is named in honor of my uncle's brother's 
great-great-grandfather Otis J. McFeely, a recluse millionaire that funded 
my software schooling and adult book store enterprise while I learned 
programming techniques. I felt so indebted to him that my first big software 
undertaking was named after him.

Sadly, after a breakfast of Chardonnay and donuts with sprinkles, Otis
stood up, gathered a packet of Burpee apple seeds, a can of Sterno and
his trusty walking stick. Mumbling something about the luck of the
Irish, he wandered off into the bush of Indianapolis to never be heard
from again.

To this day, we still suspect that he roams the Earth, at least in
spirit.
