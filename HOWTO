Introduction

The documentation for McFeely is a bit spread out and confusing. This
document attempts to alleviate some of the confusion by providing a
step by step guide to installing (from RPM) and then running a mcfeely
server and client installation. 

In its first draft this document will only describe the client and
server on a local box without ssh being involved. Discussion about use
with ssh will be added later.

Installation

To install you will need the following rpms:

  mcfeely-client
  mcfeely-server
  mcfeely-common
  knetstring

You should be able to find all of these in the mcfeely distribution 
directory at http://web.systhug.com/mcfeely/dist/

knetstring provides the shared library used by the client and server
to talk with one another. 

Before you install the rpms, create the user and groups which McFeely
needs to run.

ALSO: because of some weirdness with installing perl modules from RPMS
on different versions of Redhat you may find that you need to do the
following to make the perl modules that McFeely will install visible
to your system:

   cd /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl
   cp -a 5.005/* .
   rm -r 5.005
   ln -s . 5.005

YOU MAKE THESE SORTS OF CHANGES AT YOUR OWN RISK. MAKE SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU ARE DOING!

-  create a mcfeely user with a home of /opt/mcfeely and /bin/bash
   as its shell
-  create a mcfeely group, this is the group the server runs as
-  create a mcqueue group. To this group add users who you wish to
   allow to enqueue mcfeely jobs. You don't want to do this all
   will nilly, think before you act. We suggest that you don't add
   anyone to this group until after you have completed your testing
   and are familiar with the system.

The mcfeely server is a continuously running processes so should
therefore start at boot time and run continuously from there. At this
time no initscripts are provided. They are in the works. To start
things run:

   /opt/mcfeely/bin/mcfeely-start

This program will log to STDERR so you may want to catch that.
