read each job
  read each task
  create objects for each task that NEEDS_DONE
  when a task FAILS, the whole job fails.  the results of the other
  tasks in the job become immaterial.  there are 3 possibilities for
  each of those tasks
    1. the task is being attempted
       in this case, nothing is done to the task.  when its attempt
       finishes, it will see that the job has FAILED and it will
       either
       a. report its success
       b. report its failure
       c. report 'attempt aborted'
       then it removes itself and anything waiting on it and
       decrements JOB_NTASKS appropriately
    2. the task has already succeeded or failed
       nothing to do here
    3. the task is in the queue, but it's time has not yet come
       the task will be dequeued and everything which depends upon it
       will also be removed
