o if mcfeely-queue is sent >4096 bytes the pipe between
  McFeely::Job and mcfeely-queue has a problem and a broken pipe
  error happens. It's not immediately clear if this is a problem
  in mcfeely-queue or in McFeely::Job::enqueue
o mv the files in /opt/mcfeely/lib/perl into the mcfeely-server
  rpm since they are only used by mcfeely-server. this poses
  some weird directory conflict issues with mcfeely-common though.
  (2000.0628)
o in read_results when $msg is multiline the log output does not
  have the jobid:tasknum (comm) line on it. this can be fixed by
  turning $msg into an array and looping over it. (2000.0628)
o in many place files are opened and if there is an error it is not
  trapped in any particular fashion (2000.0623)
o create a collection of docs that get installed with the rpm so
  that a description of what's going on is readily available
  (2000.0621)
o minimize the kiva aspects in this and other rpms so we can have
  a more general distribution (2000.0515)
o generic non kiva specific init scripts
  matt says he's working on this one (2000.0515)
o a suite of test and example comms  (2000.0515)

o move ::Task, ::Job, ::MetaTask to using the ahosey approvided
  eval() and die() methods which make life much easier
  (2000.0522: cdent, mml)
o accessor methods inside Task that Job uses such that Task has
  a structure with names instead of just a list (2000.0522:
  cdent, mml)

Stuff in here prior to May 15, 2000

o post-tape-recovery queue fixer
o make sure we're really writing to file every time we think we are
o firewall stuff
o abstract the mailing in mail_report so it is not dependendent on
  /bin/mail but instead uses something like Mail::Send or whatever
