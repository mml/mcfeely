o post-tape-recovery queue fixer
o make sure we're really writing to file every time we think we are
o firewall stuff
o need a mcfeely-kiva rpm (completely separate from this repository)

o improve report readibility (some changes made, but there's room for
  more)
o abstract the mailing in mail_report so it is not dependendent on
  /bin/mail but instead uses something like Mail::Send or whatever
