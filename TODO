o Spawner either in the distribution or folded into
  mcfeely-client. Adrian believes this is top priority.
  (2000.0515)
o minimize the kiva aspects in this and other rpms so we can have
  a more general distribution (2000.0515)
o generic non kiva specific init scripts
  matt says he's working on this one (2000.0515)
o a suite of test and example comms  (2000.0515)

Stuff in here prior to May 15, 2000

o post-tape-recovery queue fixer
o make sure we're really writing to file every time we think we are
o firewall stuff
o improve report readibility (some changes made, but there's room for
  more)
o abstract the mailing in mail_report so it is not dependendent on
  /bin/mail but instead uses something like Mail::Send or whatever
o in mcfeely-ttpd.c a write is made to the the pipe when 'program not
  found'. It doesn't say what program. It should.
o BUG: If the client side does not return any exit code at all, the
  server side seems to get confused, neither reporting the problem,
  trying again, or failing the task.
