o post-tape-recovery queue fixer
o make sure we're really writing to file every time we think we are
o firewall stuff
o need a mcfeely-kiva rpm (completely separate from this repository)
  that we can slap on top?
o improve report readibility (some changes made, but there's room for
  more)
o abstract the mailing in mail_report so it is not dependendent on
  /bin/mail but instead uses something like Mail::Send or whatever
o in mcfeely-ttpd.c a write is made to the the pipe when 'program not
  found'. It doesn't say what program. It should.
o BUG: If the client side does not return any exit code at all, the
  server side seems to get confused, neither reporting the problem,
  trying again, or failing the task.
