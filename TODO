o mv the files in /opt/mcfeely/lib/perl into the mcfeely-server
  rpm since they are only used by mcfeely-server. this poses
  some weird directory conflict issues with mcfeely-common though.
  (2000.0628)
o in read_results when $msg is multiline the log output does not
  have the jobid:tasknum (comm) line on it. this can be fixed by
  turning $msg into an array and looping over it. (2000.0628)
o in many place files are opened and if there is an error it is not
  trapped in any particular fashion (2000.0623)
o create a collection of docs that get installed with the rpm so
  that a description of what's going on is readily available
  (2000.0621)
o move ::Task, ::Job, ::MetaTask to using the ahosey approvided
  eval() and die() methods which make life much easier
  (2000.0522: cdent, mml)
o accessor methods inside Task that Job uses such that Task has
  a structure with names instead of just a list (2000.0522:
  cdent, mml)
o abstract the mailing in mail_report so it is not dependendent on
  /bin/mail but instead uses something like Mail::Send or whatever
